🔹 Objective

In this phase, the goal is to work with messy data and apply data cleaning techniques using PySpark. This ensures the dataset is reliable before performing any further processing or analysis.

🔹 Problem Summary

We were given a dataset containing multiple data quality issues such as missing values, duplicate records, and invalid entries.
The task was to:
• Identify data quality issues

• Clean the 

• Validate the cleaned data

• Perform basic aggregation


🔹 Approach

Loaded the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame
Identified data issues such as null values, duplicates, and invalid data
Performed data cleaning:
o Removed records with missing key values
o Handled null values in important columns
o Removed duplicate records
o Filtered out invalid data
Validated the cleaned dataset by comparing before and after results
Performed aggregation to derive insights

🔹 Key Transformations Used


• dropna() → to handle missing values
• dropDuplicates() → to remove duplicate records
• filter() → to remove invalid data
• groupBy() → for aggregation

🔹 Output / Results


The following outputs were generated:
• Cleaned dataset with no invalid or duplicate records

• Aggregated data showing distribution across categories

Screenshots of outputs are available in the outputs/ folder.

🔹 Data Engineering Considerations


• Removed invalid and inconsistent data to improve accuracy
• Ensured no duplicate records affect results
• Validated cleaned data before performing aggregation

🔹 Challenges Faced


• Handling multiple types of data issues in a single dataset
• Deciding how to treat missing values without losing important data

🔹 Learnings


• Importance of data cleaning in real-world scenarios
• Techniques to handle missing and invalid data
• How poor data quality impacts final results
